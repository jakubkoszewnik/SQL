/*
Use the CTE from the previous task in a new (second) CTE to create a sample with the following data:

ad_month: the first day of the month of the ad date (obtained from ad_date);
utm_campaign, total_cost, impressions, clicks, conversion_value, CTR, CPC, CPM, ROMI â€” the same fields with the same conditions as in the previous task.
Perform a final selection with the following fields:
ad_month;
utm_campaign, total_cost, impressions, clicks, conversion_value, CTR, CPC, CPM, ROMI;
For each utm_campaign in each month, add a new field: 'Difference between CPM, CTR, and ROMI' in the current month compared to the previous month in percentage.
